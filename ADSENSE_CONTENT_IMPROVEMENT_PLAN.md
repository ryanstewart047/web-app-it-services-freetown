# 🎯 AdSense Content Improvement Action Plan

## 🚨 Current Issue
Google AdSense rejected your site for **"Low value content"** - meaning your site needs more unique, high-quality content that provides value to users.

- ✅ 8 comprehensive blog articles (800-1,680 words each)
- ✅ Professional services pages
- ✅ Good site structure and navigation
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Fast loading times
- ✅ Clear call-to-actions

## ❌ What's Missing (Needs Improvement)

### 1. **Insufficient Unique Content**
- Current pages have too little text content
- Need more detailed service descriptions
- Missing detailed pricing information
- Lack of educational/help content

### 2. **Thin Content Pages**
- Some pages are too short (< 300 words)
- Need more in-depth information
- Missing FAQs and guides

### 3. **Content Depth Issues**
- Not enough expertise demonstration
- Limited Sierra Leone-specific content
- Need more unique value proposition
