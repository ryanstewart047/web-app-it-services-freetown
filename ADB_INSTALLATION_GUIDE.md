- Installing/uninstalling apps
- Debugging applications
- Accessing device shell
- Transferring files

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "adb is not recognized" (Windows)

**Cause:** ADB not in system PATH

**Solution:**
1. Verify ADB location: `C:\platform-tools\adb.exe`
2. Re-add to PATH (see Step 3 of Windows installation)
3. Restart Command Prompt
4. Try: `C:\platform-tools\adb.exe version` (full path)

### Issue: "command not found: adb" (Mac)

**Cause:** ADB not in PATH

**Solution:**

```bash
# Find where ADB is installed
which adb

# If nothing appears, reinstall:
brew install android-platform-tools

# Or add to PATH manually:
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/platform-tools' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Issue: "no permissions" (Mac)

**Cause:** ADB doesn't have execute permissions

**Solution:**

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/platform-tools/adb
```

### Issue: "unauthorized" device

**Cause:** USB debugging not authorized

**Solution:**
1. Disconnect device
2. Revoke USB debugging authorizations on device:
   - Settings â†’ Developer Options â†’ Revoke USB debugging authorizations
3. Reconnect device
4. Accept authorization popup

### Issue: Device not detected

**Solutions:**

**Windows:**
1. Install device-specific USB drivers:
   - Samsung: https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver
   - Google: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
   - Others: Check manufacturer website

2. Update ADB:
```cmd
cd C:\platform-tools
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

**Mac:**
1. Update ADB:
```bash
brew upgrade android-platform-tools
```

2. Restart ADB server:
```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

**Both:**
1. Try different USB cable (use original if possible)
2. Try different USB port (avoid USB hubs)
3. Restart device
4. Restart computer
5. Enable "File Transfer" mode on Android (swipe down â†’ tap USB notification)

### Issue: Multiple devices connected

**Solution:** Specify device by serial number

```bash
# List devices to get serial number
adb devices

# Use specific device
adb -s RF8N12345678 shell getprop ro.product.model
```
