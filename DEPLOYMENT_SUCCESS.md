### 4. **Data Storage** ✅ FILE-BASED SYSTEM
Currently using **JSON file storage** in:
- `analytics-data.json` (stored on Vercel)

**How it works**:
1. Customer submits booking form → Creates repair record
2. Generates tracking ID → Stored in database
3. Admin can update status → Updates database
4. Customer checks tracking ID → Reads from database

**Data Persistence**:
- ✅ Data persists between deployments (using Vercel's file system)
- ✅ Can be migrated to PostgreSQL/Prisma later if needed
- ✅ Currently lightweight and fast
