# CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Password Security Implemented

The admin system now uses secure password hashing instead of plain text passwords.

### How to Set Your Password

1. **Generate a password hash:**
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update('YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD_HERE').digest('hex'))"
   ```

2. **Add to Vercel Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` = `[the hash from step 1]`
   - Redeploy your site

### Default Password (CHANGE IMMEDIATELY!)

The default password is currently set to a demo value. **You MUST change this immediately!**

### Security Features Implemented

✅ **Password Hashing**: SHA-256 with constant-time comparison
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Max 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
✅ **Session Management**: Secure HTTP-only cookies
✅ **Brute Force Protection**: 1-second delay on failed attempts
✅ **Form Validation**: Server-side validation with sanitization
✅ **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization removes malicious scripts
✅ **IP Tracking**: All auth attempts are logged with IP addresses

### Form Validation

All form submissions now go through:
- Server-side validation
- XSS/injection attack prevention
- Rate limiting (10 submissions per hour per IP)
- Input sanitization
- Email/phone format validation
- Minimum length requirements

### What Was Removed

❌ Plain text passwords in code
❌ Client-side only authentication
❌ Unvalidated form submissions
❌ Direct localStorage password storage

### Testing

1. Try logging in with wrong password → Should show error after delay
2. Try 6 times → Should get rate limited
3. Submit empty form → Should show validation errors
4. Submit form with `<script>` tags → Should be sanitized/blocked

### Emergency Access

If you get locked out:
1. Wait 15 minutes for rate limit to reset
2. Or clear the `admin_session` cookie in browser DevTools
3. Or set a new ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH in Vercel

## Next Steps

1. Generate your own password hash
2. Set ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH environment variable in Vercel
3. Redeploy
4. Test login with new password
5. Delete this file after reading
