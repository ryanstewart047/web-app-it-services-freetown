# GitHub Pages Manual Deployment

## 🌐 Your site will be deployed to:
**https://ryanstewart047.github.io/web-app-it-services-freetown/**

## Quick Setup Steps:

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/ryanstewart047/web-app-it-services-freetown/settings/pages
2. Under "Source": Select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **mobile-popup-fix** 
4. Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Set Up Form Handling
Your forms need an external service since GitHub Pages is static-only:

**Option A: Formspree (Recommended)**
1. Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a new form
3. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in book-appointment.html with your form ID

**Option B: Netlify Forms**
1. Also deploy to Netlify 
2. Add `netlify` attribute to forms

### 3. Build CSS (if needed)
```bash
npm install
npm run build-css-prod
```

## Current Features That Work:
- ✅ All static pages (home, appointments, tracking, etc.)
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Interactive JavaScript features
- ✅ CSS animations and styling
- ✅ Form UI (needs external processing)

## Alternative: Full-Feature Deployment
For complete functionality including form processing and emails:
- **Vercel**: Deploy with `/api/appointments.js` (recommended)
- **Netlify**: Supports serverless functions
- **Railway**: Full server hosting

Your static files are ready for GitHub Pages! 🎉
