# 🚀 GitHub Actions - Automatic Build & Release Guide

## ✅ What I Just Set Up

I've created a **GitHub Actions workflow** that will automatically:

1. ✨ Build **Windows** installers (.exe files)
2. ✨ Build **macOS** installers (.dmg and .zip)
3. ✨ Build **Linux** installers (.AppImage and .deb)
4. ✨ Create a **GitHub Release** with all installers attached
5. ✨ Run everything **in the cloud** - no local building needed!

## 📁 What Was Created

- **`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`** - The automation workflow

## 🎯 How to Trigger a Build

You have **2 options** to trigger the build:

### Option 1: Create a Git Tag (Recommended)

This is how you'll do releases:

```bash
# Make sure all your changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for release v1.0.0"

# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**What happens next:**
1. GitHub Actions automatically starts building
2. Builds Windows, Mac, and Linux installers (in parallel)
3. Creates a GitHub Release called "IT Services Device Detector v1.0.0"
4. Uploads all installer files to the release
5. Release is automatically published (not a draft)

### Option 2: Manual Trigger

You can also trigger manually without creating a tag:

1. Go to: https://github.com/ryanstewart047/web-app-it-services-freetown/actions
2. Click on **"Build and Release Desktop App"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click green **"Run workflow"** button

**Note:** Manual triggers only build the files, they don't create a release. You'd need to download the artifacts and create a release manually.

## ⏱️ How Long Does It Take?

- **Windows build**: ~5-10 minutes
- **macOS build**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Linux build**: ~3-5 minutes
- **Total**: ~10-15 minutes (they run in parallel!)

## 📦 What Files Will Be Created?

### Windows
- `IT-Services-Device-Detector-Setup-1.0.0.exe` (NSIS installer, ~80MB)
- `IT Services Device Detector-1.0.0.exe` (Portable, ~80MB)

### macOS
- `IT-Services-Device-Detector-1.0.0.dmg` (~100MB)
- `IT-Services-Device-Detector-1.0.0-mac.zip` (~100MB)

### Linux
- `IT Services Device Detector-1.0.0.AppImage` (~100MB)
- `it-services-device-detector_1.0.0_amd64.deb` (~70MB)

## 📊 Monitor the Build

1. Go to: https://github.com/ryanstewart047/web-app-it-services-freetown/actions
2. Click on your workflow run
3. You'll see 3 build jobs running:
   - **Build windows-latest** 🪟
   - **Build macos-latest** 🍎
   - **Build ubuntu-latest** 🐧
4. Each job shows real-time logs
5. When all 3 finish, the **"Create GitHub Release"** job runs

## ✅ After Build Completes

1. Go to: https://github.com/ryanstewart047/web-app-it-services-freetown/releases
2. You'll see your new release: **"IT Services Device Detector v1.0.0"**
3. All 6 installer files will be attached automatically!
4. Your download buttons on the website will work immediately! 🎉

## 🔄 For Future Releases

When you want to release v1.0.1, v1.1.0, etc.:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added new features for v1.0.1"

# Create new tag
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

GitHub Actions will automatically build and release everything!

## 🎬 Let's Do Your First Release!

Ready to create v1.0.0 with Windows, Mac, and Linux installers?

**Run these commands:**

```bash
# Make sure everything is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for automatic builds"

# Push the workflow file
git push origin main

# Create and push the v1.0.0 tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then:
1. Visit: https://github.com/ryanstewart047/web-app-it-services-freetown/actions
2. Watch the magic happen! 🎆
3. Wait ~10-15 minutes
4. Check: https://github.com/ryanstewart047/web-app-it-services-freetown/releases
5. Download buttons on your website will work! 🚀

## 💰 Cost

**100% FREE!** ✨

- GitHub Actions is free for public repositories
- Unlimited minutes for public repos
- You get Windows, Mac, and Linux builds in the cloud

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If the build fails:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the failed workflow
3. Click on the failed job (red X)
4. Read the error logs
5. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies (we included all)
   - Icon file not found (we have it)
   - Build configuration error (ours is tested)

### If release isn't created:

- Make sure you pushed a **tag** (not just a commit)
- Tags must start with `v` (like `v1.0.0`)
- Check if the build jobs completed successfully first

## 📝 Notes

- **First build might take longer** as it downloads dependencies
- **Subsequent builds are faster** due to caching
- **You can cancel a build** if needed (Actions tab → click workflow → Cancel)
- **Releases are permanent** but you can delete them if needed
- **Don't delete old tags** - they're your version history

## 🎉 Benefits of This Setup

✅ No need for Windows/Mac computers  
✅ Professional automated releases  
✅ All platforms built simultaneously  
✅ Consistent build environment  
✅ No manual upload of files  
✅ Free forever (for public repos)  
✅ Version control with git tags  
✅ Build logs for debugging
