Look for the section that says **"Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them."**

1. Click in that area (or drag files onto it)
2. Select the 2 files you downloaded:
   - `IT Services Device Detector-1.0.0.AppImage`
   - `it-services-device-detector_1.0.0_amd64.deb`
3. Wait for them to upload (may take a few minutes - they're large files)

2. Click the big green **"Publish release"** button

## ‚úÖ After Publishing

Once published, the download buttons on your website will work! They'll automatically download from:

## ü™ü What About Windows and Mac?

The Windows and Mac installers can only be built on those specific operating systems:

- **Windows**: Need Windows OS to build `.exe` files
- **macOS**: Need macOS to build `.dmg` and `.app` files

For now, publish the Linux version and users can:
1. Use Linux installers
2. Build from source on Windows/Mac
3. Wait for you to build Windows/Mac versions later

## üì∏ Screenshots for Reference

When creating the release, you'll see:

1. **Tag dropdown**: Type `v1.0.0` and click "Create new tag"
2. **Title field**: Enter the release title
3. **Description box**: Paste the release notes (supports Markdown)
4. **Attach binaries**: Drag and drop area for files
5. **Set as latest**: Checkbox at bottom
6. **Publish button**: Big green button

## üéØ Summary

‚úÖ **Binaries location**: `desktop-app/dist/`  
‚úÖ **Tag to create**: `v1.0.0`  
‚úÖ **Files to upload**: 2 Linux installers (AppImage + DEB)  
‚úÖ **After publish**: Download buttons on website will work!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Filenames must stay exactly as they are** - don't rename them
2. **Upload both files** even if you only use Linux
3. **"Set as latest release"** must be checked for `/latest/` URLs to work
4. You can always **edit the release** later to add Windows/Mac builds

Good luck! üöÄ
