     "id": "1",
     "title": "Welcome Offer - 20% Off All Repairs!",
     "description": "Get 20% off on all computer and mobile repairs this week!\n\nValid for:\n‚úì Screen replacements\n‚úì Battery repairs\n‚úì Software fixes\n‚úì Data recovery\n\nBook now and save!",
     "imageUrl": "https://i.postimg.cc/13b2KwK8/images.jpg",

     "updatedAt": "2025-01-24T00:00:00.000Z"
