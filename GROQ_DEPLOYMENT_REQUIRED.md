# 🔒 Groq API Key Security - Action Required

## ✅ What I've Done

Your new API key is now secured:
```
gsk_Tar81...HaS (Full key in your .env.local file - NEVER commit to GitHub!)
```

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Created backend proxy at `/api/groq-proxy`
2. ✅ Updated all frontend code to use proxy (not direct Groq API)
3. ✅ Removed all hardcoded API keys from frontend
4. ✅ Updated `.env.local` with new key
5. ✅ API key now only in environment variables (secure!)

## ⚠️ Important: Deployment Required

**Your chat and troubleshoot features won't work on GitHub Pages** because GitHub Pages is static-only (no backend/API routes).

### You MUST deploy the backend to one of these (all have FREE tiers):

### Option 1: Vercel (EASIEST & RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Add API key
vercel env add GROQ_API_KEY
# Paste: gsk_Tar81...HaS (your full key from .env.local)

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

**Your site will be live at:** `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Keep GitHub Pages for Frontend + Vercel for Backend
1. Deploy to Vercel (as above)
2. Update frontend to point to Vercel API:

**File:** `lib/groq-ai-client.ts` (line 6)
```typescript
const GROQ_PROXY_URL = 'https://your-project.vercel.app/api/groq-proxy'
```

3. Redeploy GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## 🧪 Test After Deployment

1. Visit your site
2. Go to Chat page
3. Send message: "Hello"
4. Check browser console (F12)
5. Should see: `✅ Groq AI response received via proxy`

## ❓ Why This Change?

Groq detected your API key was exposed in the browser and revoked it. Their recommendation:
> "Implement a backend to securely manage your API key. This prevents the key from being exposed in the browser or front-end code."

Now your key is safe! 🔐
